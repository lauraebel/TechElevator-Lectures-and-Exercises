        <!-- 
            It is common to include JavaScript libraries at the bottom of the body
            to allow them to load after the HTML and CSS.  This allows larger JS
            files to load while the user reviews the initial page.  Otherwise, a large
            JS file may cause the page to appear to have a slow load time. 

            Order is still important so if the script is loaded here, its methods
            are not available to code in the head or body, but it is to other JS
            loaded after it here at the bottom of the file.
