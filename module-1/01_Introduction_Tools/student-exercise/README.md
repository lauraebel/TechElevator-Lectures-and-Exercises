# Introduction to Tools

Welcome to Tech Elevator! This will be the first of many exercises you will complete throughout the cohort. The intent of the exercises is to reinforce the concepts you have learned during each day, and to provide you the opportunity to practice your new skills.

The Introduction to Tools exercise covers Git and several Unix commands typically used alongside Git. This exercise is intended to help you gain familiarity and confidence working with the command line inside the Terminal.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise, students will understand:

* How to navigate the directory structure.
* How to navigate to the "home" directory.
* How to identify the directory they are currently in.
* How to display files within a directory.
* How to identify files vs directories.
* How to rename, copy, and remove files and directories.
* Common techniques used when working with Git.
* How to push work to Git for review.
* How to use the README file to complete exercises.

## Evaluation Criteria & Functional Requirements

* Each of the questions identified in the introduction-to-tools-exercises.txt file have been answered completely.
* Directories and Files that have been modified, added, removed, moved, or renamed reflect the work that was completed during the exercise.
* The appropriate commits have been added to Git.
* **Exercise Feedback** questions have been provided at the bottom of this file. All of the questions not marked as optional have been answered. This should be completed for all exercises you work on throughout the cohort.

## Getting Started

* Open a terminal window in the same directory this README file is found in. This is commonly referred to as the "project root".
* Open the `introduction-to-tools-exercises.txt` file in your preferred text editor. Examples of a text editor include Notepad, Notepad++, or Visual Studio Code.
* Complete the tasks outlined in the `introduction-to-tools-exercises.txt` file by providing your answers to the questions in the file. **Don't forget to save your work as you work through the exercise.**

## Tips and Tricks

* The exercise folder contains this file, plus a java-helloworld folder.  The java-helloworld folder represents a simplified Java project. (The layout of an
actual Java project will be covered in later lectures.) For now, the reduced structure provides an opportunity to navigate between folders, and to work with files as you would in an actual Java project, but cleared of much of the clutter found in real projects.
* When working through exercises at Tech Elevator, you should refer to the README.md files found at the root of each exercise folder for clarification on what is expected for each exercise, the work that needs to be completed, and information related to the concepts you should be learning in each exercise. There will also be a section that includes helpful tips, tricks, and additional links that might be of value to dig deeper into the concepts discussed for each exercise. **Be sure to make use of the README file as you work through each exercise.**
